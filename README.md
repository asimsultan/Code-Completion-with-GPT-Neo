# Code Completion with GPT-Neo

Welcome to the Code Completion with GPT-Neo project! This project focuses on building a code completion tool using GPT-Neo.

## Introduction

Code completion involves predicting the next part of code based on the context. In this project, we leverage the power of GPT-Neo to build a code completion tool using a dataset of code snippets.

## Dataset

For this project, we will use a custom dataset of code snippets. You can create your own dataset and place it in the `data/code_snippets.csv` file.

## Project Overview

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Datasets

### Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gpt_neo_code_completion.git
cd gpt_neo_code_completion

# Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure your data includes code snippets. Place these files in the data/ directory.
# The data should be in a CSV file with one column: code.

# To fine-tune the GPT-Neo model for code completion, run the following command:
python scripts/train.py --data_path data/code_snippets.csv

# To evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model, run:
python scripts/evaluate.py --model_path models/ --data_path data/code_snippets.csv
